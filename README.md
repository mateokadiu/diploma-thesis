# diploma-thesis
A project for diploma thesis defense. My first time using Node, MongoDB, Express and NgRx Data.
The goal of this project was to create a task organizer using interesting technologies and reactive pattern.
This project consists of three types of users, Admin, Employee, Manager. Users are authenticated and authorized with JWT access and refresh tokens.
